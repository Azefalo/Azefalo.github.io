The focus went beyond “what changed” generation by generation (services, performance, spectrum), and also addressed why it changed through market dynamics, technology scaling, and global standardization processes.\n\nA controversial but essential topic for modern wireless systems was also explored: the potential health impacts of electromagnetic (EM) waves and the societal concerns surrounding mobile deployments. The work aimed to keep a balanced view, separating established physical mechanisms (mainly thermal effects) from debated non-thermal hypotheses, while explaining why scientific opinions can diverge depending on methods, exposure metrics, and evidence quality.",
      "tecnica": "The course covered the ecosystem that drives mobile-network innovation, linking technical evolution to market cycles, investment dynamics, and the push from smartphones, IoT adoption, and industrial connectivity. This “market lens” clarified why each new generation is not only a performance upgrade, but also a response to demand, competition, and feasibility at scale.\n\nKey topics included how mobile technologies become “official” through global standardization. The role of 3GPP was studied as a partnership framework that consolidates specifications defining architecture, protocol layers, interfaces, requirements, and testing for GSM/UMTS/LTE/5G NR, while also structuring the transition to 5G-Advanced and early 6G roadmaps via Release planning and timelines.\n\nFrom a physical-layer perspective, the work focused on how spectrum selection and propagation constraints shape system design. Coverage vs. capacity trade-offs were connected to the progressive move toward higher frequencies, and the implications were discussed in terms of wavelength, antenna integration, and the practical need for antenna arrays, beamforming, and massive MIMO to maintain link budget and increase throughput. Basic RF relationships (frequency-wavelength links and related measurement concepts) were used to ground these conclusions.\n\nThe hardware dimension was also emphasized: semiconductor scaling as an enabler for higher integration, stronger compute capabilities, and tighter coupling between communication and AI features. Expected directions for 6G were examined, including wider bandwidths (potentially extending toward sub-THz/terahertz ranges), improved localization, network automation with AI/ML, and the emergence of concepts such as battery-less or “zero-energy” devices for massive sensing and data collection.\n\nFor the selected topic (Cancer & EM waves), the course required a state-of-the-art review approach. Exposure concepts (device proximity, infrastructure, and typical field levels) were placed alongside the mainstream emphasis on thermal effects, then contrasted with publications that argue for possible long-term non-thermal impacts versus sources highlighting limitations in replication, dosimetry, and the difficulty of extrapolating lab conditions to real-world human physiology. I presented this synthesis in an evaluated oral talk, concluding with a pragmatic precaution stance: reduce unnecessary exposure when feasible without turning uncertainty into alarmism.",

      "relacao_projeto_profissional": "This course directly supports my professional trajectory in embedded systems and connected devices because it connects real industry constraints (standardization, roadmap timing, spectrum availability, hardware scaling) to the design decisions behind IoT and mobile connectivity. Understanding the 3GPP ecosystem and the evolution from LTE to 5G NR and beyond helps position cellular IoT technologies within realistic constraints for products and industrial systems.\n\nIt also strengthened my ability to account for societal and safety concerns that still influence engineering decisions. For roles involving IoT, smart systems, or telecom-connected embedded products, discussing EM exposure questions responsibly without exaggeration, but with technical grounding and awareness of uncertainty adds value when designing systems, documenting risk, or communicating with stakeholders."

We explored how group dynamics, influence, stereotypes, intercultural relations, manipulation, conflict management and psychosocial risks shape behaviours in everyday life and in professional settings.\n\tAll these concepts were constantly questioned from an ethical perspective: who is responsible for what, what makes an action just, and what it means for an action to be truly free. A central part of the course was also devoted to ethics in engineering and to intercultural communication, which I worked on through a dedicated presentation on intercultural relations and cultural adaptation.",
      "tecnica": "\tThe course began with a detailed analysis of the movie 12 Angry Men (1957), used as a practical case for social influence and group decision-making. Through this film, group pressure, minority influence, stereotypes linked to social class and origin, and the tension between emotional and rational arguments were examined. The character who insists on questioning the evidence served as an example of how one individual can progressively shift a group decision by demanding a more rigorous, fact-based discussion.\n\tKey topics included the foundations of social psychology and group dynamics, at the crossroads between psychology and sociology. Lectures covered the interaction between individual, group and situation, with reference to authors such as Elton Mayo (Hawthorne effect and the role of social motivation), Jacob Moreno (sociometry and affective networks inside groups) and Kurt Lewin (field theory and group dynamics as a system of forces). Criteria for defining a group were presented (minimum number of people, shared goals, interdependence, roles, norms and shared values), along with distinctions between crowds, small primary groups, large temporary groups and formal organisations.\n\tAs part of the course, together with a classmate, I prepared and delivered a full presentation on intercultural communication. The work started from the UNESCO definition of culture as a set of values, norms, practices, beliefs and ways of life shared by a group, emphasising that culture also involves invisible dimensions such as communication styles and relationships to time, authority and emotions. The notion of micro-cultures was introduced to describe families, student cohorts, project teams or local communities, each with its own codes and rituals, which explains why people from the same country can behave very differently. Intercultural communication was defined as interaction between people with different cultural references, requiring competences such as active listening, curiosity, reflexivity, the ability to question stereotypes and to manage uncertainty in exchanges.\n\tThe presentation also explored practical strategies for adapting to other cultures: maintaining an open attitude, observing without immediate judgement, adjusting verbal and non-verbal communication (simplifying language, paying attention to body language, respecting hierarchy where it matters) and asking for clarification when necessary. The classic phases of cultural adaptation (honeymoon, slump, realisation and adaptation) were described to show that cultural shock is a normal stage in the learning process. Another key concept was ethnocentrism - the tendency to see one's own culture as the central or superior reference - and the importance of recognising it in order to build more respectful and effective intercultural relations. Practical tools for communicating across cultures were proposed: using clear and concrete language, avoiding jargon and idioms, combining oral explanations with written notes or diagrams, providing concrete examples and regularly checking understanding by asking others to reformulate the message.\n\tOn the ethical side, the course worked with precise distinctions between morality, ethics and deontology. Morality was presented as a set of values and concrete rules that distinguish good from bad, ethics as a reflective process that questions human actions and their consequences, and deontology as the set of duties linked to a professional practice. Several ethical frameworks for decision-making were studied: ethics of reciprocity (“treat others as you would like to be treated”), duty-based ethics (Kantian universal principles), utilitarian ethics (seeking the greatest good for the greatest number) and ethics of conviction (coherence between personal values and actions). These frameworks provided a structured way to analyse dilemmas.\n\tThe course also highlighted a three-question approach to ethical reflection: Where does a practice come from (historical and social origins)? What is it for (meaning and usefulness)? Where is it going (long-term impacts and finalities)? This method was applied to engineering topics to connect technical possibilities with social effects and personal responsibility. Digital ethics completed the technical content with questions about cybercrime, manipulation, privacy and data protection, big data, social media, right to disconnect and the environmental footprint of digital technologies, including energy consumption and electronic waste.\n\tFinally, the responsibilities of engineers were discussed through ethical charters and case studies. Emphasis was placed on the need to balance what is technically possible with what is socially desirable, by assessing risks, long-term impacts and the social acceptability of technologies. This integrated view of ethics, group dynamics and intercultural communication forms a methodological base for future work with connected objects, data and smart systems.",
      "sistema_de_curso": "The course was organised in around 14 sessions of 1h15. Teaching combined a common screening and discussion of 12 Angry Men, interactive lectures based on the professor's slides on social psychology, group dynamics, ethics and digital issues, and student-led presentations.

Through the film analysis, group presentations and debates, it became possible to identify ethical and intercultural issues while remaining attentive to people's limits and vulnerabilities. Preparing and delivering the presentation on intercultural communication required questioning the objectives and implicit assumptions behind ways of working together, reflecting on stereotypes and ethnocentrism, and considering the social acceptability of behaviours and communication styles. The need to structure arguments, adapt explanations to a diverse audience and react in real time to questions corresponds to agile implementation of chosen strategies. Continuous reflection on personal values, cultural background, biases and reactions - for example in discussions on discrimination, digital surveillance or cultural shock - supported a genuinely reflective evaluation of progress and limitations.",

In these fields, technical choices affect privacy, safety, environmental impact, work organisation and power relations inside companies and in society, and they are often implemented by teams composed of people with very different cultural backgrounds. Studying social psychology, ethics and intercultural communication helped to see teams, organisations and users as complex groups with histories, norms and expectations, and to anticipate how technologies and communication styles can reinforce or challenge existing dynamics.\n\tFor future roles in industry or research, this background supports the ability to question the purpose of the systems being designed, to evaluate their social and environmental impacts, and to defend responsible choices when facing dilemmas between performance, cost and ethical concerns. The specific work on intercultural communication strengthened the capacity to collaborate with international colleagues, adapt language and behaviour, and transform cultural differences into an asset rather than a source of conflict. Altogether, the course contributes to building a professional profile of an engineer who is technically competent and also aware of his responsibilities towards people, organisations and the broader society."
